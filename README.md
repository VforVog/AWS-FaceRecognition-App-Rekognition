This is an AWS based Face Recognition App! By using AWS resources, such as 
S3 Bucket, Lambda, IAM, Rekognition and DynamoDB.

We execute it with AWS CLI Commands to import and configure the aws resources 
-you can also do that from the aws desktop-

Then with Python we upload Images to train the Machine Learning of Rekognition. 
Finally we run the app!
